# FFC_Voron_Connector
Usable for Voron 2.4 and Afterburner in case you would like to exchange the wirings between Mainboard and Afterburner by FFC Conncector.
This project contains the PCB Layout for exchanging your existing HARTK V4.0 PCB by such an one, were you can connect an 20Pin FFC cable (from MELTBRO).
Please be aware that i'm using two AUX slots for:
 - 5 V Pinda Probe
 - 12V LED light located on Afterburner!
